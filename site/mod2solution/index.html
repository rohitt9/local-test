An isolated rat will almost always become a junkie. A rat with a good life almost never will, no matter how many drugs you make available to it. As Bruce put it: he was realizing that addiction isn’t a disease. Addiction is an adaptation. It’s not you it’s the cage you live in.</div></div></div>

		<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><div class="out"><div class="title" style="background-color: #FEE059;">Ryan Roy</div><div class="body">Loneliness isn’t the physical absence of other people, he said—it’s the sense that you’re not sharing anything that matters with anyone else. If you have lots of people around you—perhaps even a husband or wife, or a family, or a busy workplace—but you don’t share anything that matters with them, then you’ll still be lonely.</div></div></div>

		<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12" ><div class="out" id="unq"><div class="title" style="background-color: #CD82FE;">Karan McHuge</div><div class="body">The opposite of addiction isn't sobriety. It's connection. It's all I can offer. It's all that will help [you] in the end. If you are alone, you cannot escape addiction. If you are loved, you have a chance. For a hundred years we have been singing war songs about addicts. All along, we should have been singing love songs to them.</div></div></div>
